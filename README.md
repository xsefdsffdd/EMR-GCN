*****EMR-GCN*****

The implementation of EMR-GCN in our paper:

EMR-GCN: Electronic Medical Record based Graph Convolutional Network Learning

*****Require*****

Python 3.6

Tensorflow 1.11.0

*****Reproducing Results*****

Run python train.py 

********************
The dataset used in paper is not public, so that the preprocessing modules are not released. However, you can directly test the diagnostic result by replacing the EMR documents based on our pre-trained model.
