EMR-GCN
The implementation of EMR-GCN in our paper:

EMR-GCN: Electronic Medical Record based Graph Convolutional Network Learning

Require
Python 3.6

Tensorflow 1.11.0

Reproducing Results

Run python train.py 

Because we did not publish the dataset this time, the preprocessing modules was not published. However, users could directly test by replacing the EMR document based on our pre-trained model.
